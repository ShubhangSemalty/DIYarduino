1. RADAR:
Radar is a long-range object detection system that uses radio waves to establish certain parameters of an object like its range, speed and position. Radar technology is used in aircrafts, missiles, marine, weather predictions and automobiles.
The Arduino Radar Project is more of a visual project than it is a circuit implementation. Of course, I will be using different hardware like Arduino UNO, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor and a Servo Motor but the main aspect is the visual representation in the Processing Application.

If you remember, I have already used the Processing Application in one of the earlier Arduino Projects involving MPU-6050 Sensor. I suggest you to take a look at that project before proceeding (you donâ€™t have to actually implement the project but understand the way it is implemented).

The circuit diagram of this Radar Project is very simple as it involves very little hardware.
